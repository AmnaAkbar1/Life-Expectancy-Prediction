# Life Expectancy Prediction
World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a world-wide survey and collected data from various regions of
the world to determine life expectancy of the people of those regions. They collected this data through local sources
and with the help of several local and international NGOs that were operating in those areas.
The data we have is a sample of the original data collected by WHO. I followed the Data Science
pipeline and built a Machine Learning model which predicts the average life expectancy of the people of an
area based on given features.

The pipeline is as follows:

  1- Data Wrangling and Preprocessing
  
  2- Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  3- Feature Selection
  
  4- Model Training
  
  5- Testing and Optimization
  
  
While solving this problem, I built an intuition about which features are useful using a thorough analysis and
built a regression model with minimum loss/error. The evaluation metric that I used is Mean Absolute
Error.
